	<h3 id='Internationalization'>Internationalization</h3>
<p>For a complete list of languages the theme has been translated into, please refer to the <a href="http://srinig.com/wordpress/themes/f2/">theme home page</a></p>

<p>Please note that most of the translations pertain to the older versions of the theme, and the newer versions, notably F2 v2.0, has many strings that has not been translated yet. You can contribute by translating the theme in your language or updating incomplete translations.</p>

<h4>Translating the theme</h4>

<p>The translation template file is named <code>f2.pot</code> and is located in the <code>languages</code> directory. The resulting PO and MO files should go in the <code>languages</code> directory, and should be named in the format <code>xx_YY.po</code> and <code>xx_YY.mo</code> files respectively. Where xx refers to the language code and YY to the locale. For example, the German translation files will have the name <code>de_DE.po</code> and <code>de_DE.mo</code>. This xx_YY should be the same as the value you define for WPLANG in wp-config.php.</p>

<p>You can use an application like <a href="http://www.poedit.net/">poEdit</a> to translate the theme, or just translate the strings in the f2.pot file and send it to the theme author. All translations sent to the author will be bundled with the next version of the theme.</p>

<h3 id='Notes'>Notes</h3>

<h4>The 'Two Sidbars' layout option</h4>

<p>The theme has a setting named 'Layout' with four options, viz., 'One Sidebar (Right)', 'One Sidebar (Left)', 'Two Sidebars', and 'No Sidebar', the first option being default.</p>

<p>When the 'Two Sidebars' option is selected, the main sidebar is displayed on the <em>left hand side</em>, and one more sidebar is added on the right hand side.</p>

<h4>Sidebar re-arrangement for different screen widths</h4>

<p>The theme is responsive, certain elements of the site gets rearraged and/or resized so that the layout nicely fits the screen. The sidebar(s) fall below the main content area when the site is viewed on smaller screen widths, this is normal behaviour. Also, even when the two sidebar layout is selected, the three column layout comes alive only when the screen width is sufficiently wide. This 'sufficient width' is even greater when sidebar width is 'large' (so it's not a good idea to choose 'two sidebar' and 'wide' sidebar layout). At screen widths less than the 'sufficient width', both the sidebars combine to form one single sidebar and shown on the left hand side.</p>

<h4>Archives page</h4>

<p>You can have an archives page that will list links to all your categories, tags and monthly archive pages. Create a new page with a name like 'Archives', choose the template 'Archives', leave the page blank, and publish the page.</p>

<h4>Fonts</h4>
<p>The theme uses Google Fonts <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Bitter">Bitter</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Gudea">Gudea</a>.</p>
